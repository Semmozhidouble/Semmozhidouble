## Professional Summary

I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in programming and backend development, currently specializing in DevOps practices and cloud technologies. My interests include automation, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and building scalable, production-ready systems.

I am actively developing hands-on projects to strengthen my expertise in infrastructure, deployment workflows, and system reliability.

**Previous GitHub Account:**  
My earlier GitHub profile (<a href="https://github.com/semmozhi-ctrl">semmozhi-ctrl</a>) became inaccessible due to account recovery issues. This account now serves as my primary professional portfolio where I am rebuilding and maintaining all current and future work.
